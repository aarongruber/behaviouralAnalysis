To do

%  Goal  %
The goal is to have an analysis package that can be used by people with rudimentary Matlab skills or expert Matlab users to analyze neural/behavioural data including:
Behaviour,  single units,  EEG, video, (maybe voltammetry?)
Utimately, there will be a GUI for many of the common analyses (reaction time, % correct vs neural activity, ….)

---- New object models ----
units (tetrods #, depth, structure, quality grade, waveform, waveform stats, timestamps) * may need read this info from a spreadsheet in the same directory
EEG (tet #, depth, struct, artifact times)
video info (position, speed; processed to remove artifacts/gaps)


----- Analyses ----
Xcorr (units, EEG, unit-multiunit, units x behavioural metric; function to produce estimates of shuffled data)
Multiple regression
Reinforcement Learning analysis of behaviour – save in TR struct for correlation with ephys data 
Replay?
Spike-field coherence
Coherence
Cohereograms
Partial directed coherence
spectra
Spectrograms
Bispectra
Stats on spectra

--- future ---
State vector decorrelation


----- Plots --------
Bar plot
Methods to show stats & mean values on plot
Method to add button on plot that pops up ANOVA and post-hoc tests
Plot vector data (e.g. regression coefficients) 
Matrix of coherence
Matrix of partial directed coherence
Baseline normalized group-averaged spectragrams
Plot data (e.g firing rate) as a function of position
make plot functs that take dataset arrays & group tags

----  Stats  ----
ANOVA: add repeated measures & test with SPSS or other package
ANOVA: do post-hoc tests and display in a convenient way
Test for sphericity
---- Other suff ----
Add Epoch times (rest 1, task, rest 2)
Speed up the data parser function?
Throw warning if rat_id data seems to be mislabelled (e.g. if there is only one instance of a rat ID)
Make a function that computes over a session
Make ‘trials’ based on video tracker (e.g. moving, walking, running, or boxA/boxB)
Replace ‘registry’ at time of construction with a function that generates registry out of already loaded animals. 

---  wish list ----     
could have program dynamically add properties for each property of the object being read in. i.e. don't require hard coding in analysis program. This would require writing a function to ‘flatten’ structures so there is only one layer, and changing code using ‘params.*’
'getTrials': use matlab style synax: such as ('Property', val) and (property = val), (property < val), (property ~= val), (property1 = val1 & property2 < val). *** should have optional switch '-session' for doing calc only within session.

%% TO DO in behavioral program
 % - add arduinoID (or com as lazy way to do it)
 % - save files at BEHv1.mat
 % - take out progressive delay in all progs except ones that say 'shaping'
 % - remove delay & odor from matching pennies protocol.
 % - use capital letters for field names
 % - move params to top level
 % - no empty entries - make them nan (either numeric or string 'nan'
 % consistemt with type for property)
 % - save probabilities of reward & odours
 % *** rectify mismatch in param names: 'L_bolus_delay', vs 'R_reward_delay'
